# "Extract Solar system" is my project, where I used **Java** and **libGDX**.

Here you can see my first full-fledged experience in using frameworks.
While doing this project I got familiar with Profiler tool in Android Studio.
I used some programs to create the game environment: Photoshop, Skin Composer, Audacity.
I tried to create an adaptive design so that my app would display correctly on devices with different screen resolutions.
Also, I got experience with connecting google mobile ads to the app.
